My name is [Enumerator's name]. First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I represent a research project in Tanzania called Evidence-Based Scaling of Improved On-Farm Storage among Smallholders (LED Project). This project aims to enhance income and food security by increasing adoption of hermetic storage bag. 

This study includes an interview, which will take approximately an hour. Data collected from households like yours will be used to understand major constraints and opportunities for improved on-farm storage technology’s adoption. 
All the information you give will be strictly anonymous, and your name will not be associated with any of your responses or given to anyone outside our project. If you would rather not answer any questions, please say so. You may opt out of this interview at any time you wish. 

Should you have any question or concern, please contact Mr. Baraka Mbesa of SUA (+255717508854)",Do you agree to participate according to the consent form explained by the enumerator and printed again
